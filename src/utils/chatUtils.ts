‚Ä¢ Missing matching endorsement and cosmetic coverage
‚Ä¢ Ensuing loss language needs clarification for sand-related damage

**Creating a Claims Demand**

Your next few steps are to create a claims demand. Listed below are the bullet point items you'll need for that:

‚Ä¢ **Step 1:** Claims demand will be compiled of but not limited to:
  - The Coastal Claims estimate
  - Photo report
  - Aerial roof measurements (such as Eagle View)
  - A demand letter

‚Ä¢ **Step 2:** Add any supporting information that the insured may have provided you (like cost invoices for example)

‚Ä¢ **Step 3:** Access demand templates in the company's CRM under "Templates" - you can populate it and save it as draft

‚Ä¢ **Step 4:** Load all of these documents into the PA folder subfolder "Demand"

‚Ä¢ **Step 5:** Send all these documents to the insurance carrier along with CC: the insured and contractor of record

**Required Peer Review Process:**

If you have any questions about this process, please set a PR with your manager and explain the questions you have.

If you do not have any questions on this process, it is still necessary for you to set a PR with your manager at a minimum of every 15 days with an explanation of claim status.

Note: If the manager feels that the peer review is not necessary, they will note the file, cancel the peer review, and advise on any direction needed.`,
